# Merge Sort Implementation

This challenge asks you to implement a simple merge sort.
Please write a C# class whose interface accepts an input array arr consisting of ints and returns that array in sorted order.
Please include in your response tests of your solution’s correctness.
On completion, please push your code to a git repository

Evaluation Criteria:

- Implementation correctness
- Minimal space and time complexity (should be bounded by Von Neumann’s algorithm)
- Code legibility
- Test quality
- Input Bounds:

- 0 ≤ arr.Count ≤ 5000 (i.e. array length less than or equal to 5000)
- -2^31 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2^31-1 (i.e. valid ints)
